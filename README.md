## Describe your topic/interest in about 150-200 words

Our topic of interest is aviation. More specifically, we are interested in how airlines initially responded to COVID-19, and how that response affected flights from commercial airlines.

Despite their sound engineering and safety protocols, airlines are still at the mercy of nature. Because of this, they deal with plenty of logistical challenges that create turbulence in their operation. The winter storm in December 2022 was an example of such an event. That event made it difficult for many people, including UBC Okanagan students, to see their families. Meanwhile, many of them had nowhere else to stay besides the airport. In the wake of this, we opted to look into flight delays. We chose COVID-19 because there is a wealth of data on it, and it is hard to find open datasets for very recent flight data.

## Describe your dataset in about 150-200 words

Unlike weather issues, which have always been a factor in aviation, an international pandemic would have been an extraordinary circumstance for airlines. Therefore, we aim to understand how airlines handled the pandemic by analyzing their flights near the beginning of the pandemic. The first known case was in December 2019, so any data during or after that month should be relevant.

Our dataset contains a list of flights from January 2020 sourced from the US Government. For each flight, it lists the IATA codes for origin and destination airports, the distance of each flight, the tail number of the aircraft, the date of the flights, and other values. Most notably, it also contains both the planned and actual times of departure and arrival times, and it tells us whether the flight was diverted or canceled. This allows us to find information about flight delays without having to futz around with multiple data sources.

In the future, we may also expand the scope to include data from December 2019 and February 2020 to get a more complete view of the initial response to the pandemic.
